# CPS-510-Payroll-DBMS

This is my academic work please do not copy.

This repository contains A1-A10 of the DBMS project from CPS 510. 

This project was a collaborative academic project by me and two of my fellow peers. We aimed to make a database management system to simplify managing, updating, deleting data of employees and associated documents.
Throughout this project we started from scratch brainstorming our design and then eventually making the database using SQL with a fully functional UI and GUI using Java.
During the assembly of this DBMS I learned valuable skills such as working in a collaborative software development environment as well as working with SQLDeveloper and learning SQL.

Breakdown:

A1 - Initial report and brainstorm for the project including end users and different views required for different users as well as functionality of the system.
A2 - EE/ER Diagram listing all the main entities and their attributes as well as their relationships with one another.
A3 - The schema design included creating all of the tables to be inserted within the database. Here we created all of the entities from the ER diagram and populated the tables with dummy data. We also created very basic queries to test the functionality.
A4 - Here we created more simple queries and created our first views to test if we could extract specific data rows. We also tested insert, update and delete queries.
A5 - Here we made our first UI using Unix, we first transferred our tables and data using the queries and had them in unix after that we could use some of the queries in A4 or A3 to test this implementation by having predetermined functions. For example, pressing "1" would insert all tables and pressing "2" would drop all tables. Additionally, advanced queries were implemented such as selecting from two joined tables and grouping the result by name.
A6/A7/A8 - In this assignment we normalized all our tables to 3NF and BCNF to reduce redundancy in the data. We also listed the candidate keys and functional dependencies of each table and the closure of the candidate keys.
A9 - Finally we completed the GUI using Java and added the functionality of managing the database tables and all the queries limited to single button clicks.
A10 - This was the final report containing the assignments and summaries of each assignment in a well formatted report, additionally the code for each part was also included in the appendix of the report.
